Basic stats corresponding to: For 100 random walks

Y data peak = 35.6290
Y data minimum = 14.5100
Y data mean = 25.7008
Y data std. dev. = 7.4403
In case the given X-Y data represent a form of probability or frequency distribution of the discrete variable X (Y being the probability or frequency), the following arithmetic mean and standard deviation values can be ascribed to X or its distribution:
Mean of X or its distribution = 28.4874
Corresponding std. dev. = 6.3045
